==================================================

[00:00:00 - 00:00:03] At the time that you started working in computer music,

[00:00:03 - 00:00:07] most computer usage was for purposes like accounting

[00:00:07 - 00:00:09] and ballistics calculations.

[00:00:09 - 00:00:12] What made you even think of using computers

[00:00:12 - 00:00:14] as a creative tool?

[00:00:14 - 00:00:19] I had come to Stanford in 1962 from three years studying

[00:00:19 - 00:00:24] in Paris with Nadia Bourlajet, who was a well-known teacher

[00:00:24 - 00:00:29] and people such as Aaron Copeland and Quincy Jones.

[00:00:29 - 00:00:32] And I were there at the same time studying.

[00:00:32 - 00:00:37] So she was an important figure in Paris, musical circles.

[00:00:37 - 00:00:42] But as important to my own education as Nadia Bourlajet

[00:00:42 - 00:00:45] was the musical scene in general in Paris.

[00:00:45 - 00:00:49] Pierre Boulez was a young avant-garde,

[00:00:49 - 00:00:53] off on Tercieble, often referred to in such a way.

[00:00:53 - 00:00:58] In Paris and had a series of concerts, the Domen music

[00:00:58 - 00:01:01] call, in which he presented new music,

[00:01:01 - 00:01:04] much of which had to do with loudspeakers, electronic music,

[00:01:04 - 00:01:08] made by the various kinds of devices

[00:01:08 - 00:01:12] that one found in radio studios broadcasting in those days,

[00:01:12 - 00:01:16] oscillators, filters, things that could be turned

[00:01:16 - 00:01:21] to musical uses by composers, if given the opportunity

[00:01:21 - 00:01:24] to work in some of these studios.

[00:01:24 - 00:01:29] So when I came to Stanford having had this rich experience

[00:01:29 - 00:01:33] in Europe, as a graduate student, I asked

[00:01:33 - 00:01:37] if there were possibilities for such and there were none.

[00:01:37 - 00:01:39] There was no studio.

[00:01:39 - 00:01:42] There was four electronic music, the only one

[00:01:42 - 00:01:45] that I knew of in this country was at Columbia at that time.

[00:01:45 - 00:01:49] In any case, my second year graduate school,

[00:01:49 - 00:01:54] my graduate studies with Leland Smith in composition,

[00:01:54 - 00:01:58] not musicology, as noted in the book, but rather

[00:01:58 - 00:02:03] a composer by Trini, I was given an article

[00:02:03 - 00:02:05] that Max Matthews had written.

[00:02:05 - 00:02:08] Max was a researcher at Bell Labs, director

[00:02:08 - 00:02:11] of the Behavioral Research Lab.

[00:02:11 - 00:02:17] And his interests not only were engineering sciences,

[00:02:17 - 00:02:18] but also music.

[00:02:18 - 00:02:22] And he had developed a program called Rich

[00:02:22 - 00:02:27] allowed computers to be used to generate acoustic signals.

[00:02:27 - 00:02:30] This, of course, was of interest in the scientific community

[00:02:30 - 00:02:31] for speech research.

[00:02:31 - 00:02:35] But Max's interests were in music.

[00:02:35 - 00:02:38] And he wrote this article published in Science

[00:02:38 - 00:02:43] in November 1963 describing this program.

[00:02:43 - 00:02:46] So that was the beginning.

[00:02:46 - 00:02:49] Now, in the very beginning of electronic music,

[00:02:49 - 00:02:52] the electronics we're talking about were actually analog.

[00:02:52 - 00:02:57] By the timing of your start in the electronic music field,

[00:02:57 - 00:02:59] you managed to get in on the ground floor

[00:02:59 - 00:03:03] of digital electronic music.

[00:03:03 - 00:03:05] In the very beginning, access to computers

[00:03:05 - 00:03:07] must have been a very big problem.

[00:03:07 - 00:03:08] Well, it was.

[00:03:08 - 00:03:13] But Stanford had kind of open view toward this

[00:03:13 - 00:03:17] and had made an invitation to the School of Humanities

[00:03:17 - 00:03:21] to look at computers and possible applications.

[00:03:21 - 00:03:24] So there was a coincidence that was my good fortune,

[00:03:24 - 00:03:28] that is, having looked at this article by Max,

[00:03:28 - 00:03:32] also realizing that the computer science department,

[00:03:32 - 00:03:35] which was then part of the School of Humanities

[00:03:35 - 00:03:40] and Sciences, was open to uses other than this sort

[00:03:40 - 00:03:43] of applications, which you described at the outset.

[00:03:43 - 00:03:49] So I met a young undergraduate, David Poole,

[00:03:49 - 00:03:51] who was a tuba player in the orchestra.

[00:03:51 - 00:03:56] Stanford Orchestra, I was the timpannist at the time

[00:03:56 - 00:03:58] of 30-year-old graduate student.

[00:03:58 - 00:04:02] David was probably a 19 or 20-year-old undergraduate.

[00:04:02 - 00:04:06] He saw me at the computer center one day holding a big box

[00:04:06 - 00:04:10] of IBM cards, which I had acquired from Max at Bell Labs,

[00:04:10 - 00:04:12] and asked what I was doing.

[00:04:12 - 00:04:16] And I told him that I was going to try

[00:04:16 - 00:04:23] and implement this program on the computer system at Stanford.

[00:04:23 - 00:04:26] And he jumped in and offered to help me.

[00:04:26 - 00:04:31] I think without David, I may not have been successful

[00:04:31 - 00:04:35] in these early years, because it was laborious.

[00:04:35 - 00:04:36] It was difficult.

[00:04:36 - 00:04:41] One had to have fairly comprehensive understanding

[00:04:41 - 00:04:43] of how computers work.

[00:04:43 - 00:04:45] My last math course had been in high school,

[00:04:45 - 00:04:50] so it was a long way for me to, and let's say it would have

[00:04:50 - 00:04:52] been a bit of a stretch for me to have tried

[00:04:52 - 00:04:55] to accomplish this all by myself.

[00:04:55 - 00:04:58] So David taught me basically all that I needed to know

[00:04:58 - 00:05:01] through over the course of several years.

[00:05:01 - 00:05:04] He got the program going, taught me how to program,

[00:05:04 - 00:05:08] taught me the basics of acoustics, all the things

[00:05:08 - 00:05:11] that I needed to understand in order to begin work

[00:05:11 - 00:05:13] with the computer.

[00:05:13 - 00:05:16] Now, it turns out that his solution to getting

[00:05:16 - 00:05:22] continuous data stream of samples from a big IBM 7090

[00:05:22 - 00:05:26] to a digital analog converter, which was actually

[00:05:26 - 00:05:30] the two letters, the X, Y, coordinates of a DEX code.

[00:05:30 - 00:05:33] This continuous data stream in order

[00:05:33 - 00:05:37] not to have small segments of sound,

[00:05:37 - 00:05:39] but rather continuous sound, turned out

[00:05:39 - 00:05:45] to be a solution to increasing the number of timeshare users

[00:05:45 - 00:05:50] on this PDP1 deck time sharing system, which I think

[00:05:50 - 00:05:52] supported two or three users.

[00:05:52 - 00:05:58] And David's solution to the problem of data bandwidth

[00:05:58 - 00:06:00] and continuous samples.

[00:06:00 - 00:06:03] Also solved their problem for fast swapping.

[00:06:03 - 00:06:06] And it's my, as I remember, the number of users

[00:06:06 - 00:06:09] after he did that went from two or three to eight or 10,

[00:06:09 - 00:06:11] something that's what.

[00:06:11 - 00:06:14] So he became a very important part

[00:06:14 - 00:06:18] of the artificial intelligence laboratory.

[00:06:18 - 00:06:21] He finished his graduate work and then went on

[00:06:21 - 00:06:25] and finished his undergraduate, I'm sorry,

[00:06:25 - 00:06:27] then did some graduate work, but he basically

[00:06:27 - 00:06:32] became of the system guru of the lab

[00:06:32 - 00:06:37] that John McCarthy directed in the early years.

[00:06:37 - 00:06:40] When you came to Stanford, then you did not immediately

[00:06:40 - 00:06:42] go to the AI lab.

[00:06:42 - 00:06:44] That was subsequent in your career.

[00:06:44 - 00:06:47] When did you go from the regular campus to the AI lab

[00:06:47 - 00:06:51] and given that you were a professor of music at that point,

[00:06:51 - 00:06:54] rather than a professor of math or computer science,

[00:06:54 - 00:06:56] what motivated you to move out there?

[00:06:56 - 00:06:59] I was a graduate student actually until 1966,

[00:06:59 - 00:07:01] when I finished my doctorate.

[00:07:01 - 00:07:06] But the initial work was done at the computer center

[00:07:06 - 00:07:11] on campus on a PDP1, which shared a 2314 disk

[00:07:12 - 00:07:14] with an IBM 7090.

[00:07:14 - 00:07:19] And in 1966 is when the AI project

[00:07:20 - 00:07:25] acquired a PDP6, which was a large machine, time shared,

[00:07:25 - 00:07:30] and moved to the DC power laboratory on the restaurant era road.

[00:07:31 - 00:07:34] And it was then that I started teaching as well that year.

[00:07:36 - 00:07:39] You're moved to the sale facility,

[00:07:39 - 00:07:42] then out on the restaurant era road was motivated

[00:07:42 - 00:07:45] in large part by your desire to have access

[00:07:45 - 00:07:47] to the computing resources there.

[00:07:47 - 00:07:50] Did you have a lot of contact with the faculty

[00:07:50 - 00:07:53] who were doing the more hardcore computer science research,

[00:07:53 - 00:07:58] like robotics or formal proofs of computer programs?

[00:07:58 - 00:07:59] Yes, I did.

[00:07:59 - 00:08:01] I mean, it was one community of people,

[00:08:01 - 00:08:05] some having more stature than others, I'd say.

[00:08:05 - 00:08:07] I was not funded.

[00:08:07 - 00:08:11] And the work that I did, and also with Leland Smith,

[00:08:11 - 00:08:14] who joined me in this work,

[00:08:14 - 00:08:17] who had been my composition professor,

[00:08:17 - 00:08:21] now then in 1966, a colleague, senior colleague.

[00:08:21 - 00:08:26] We were unsupported, so therefore we were constrained

[00:08:27 - 00:08:30] in the hours in which we could use the system

[00:08:30 - 00:08:35] to weekends and nights, and I would say some very late nights.

[00:08:36 - 00:08:41] But there was one researcher, Raj Reddy,

[00:08:41 - 00:08:43] who was went on to Carnegie Mellon,

[00:08:43 - 00:08:46] and I think director of their robotics lab,

[00:08:46 - 00:08:49] who at that time was working in speech recognition.

[00:08:49 - 00:08:54] And he and I, of course, had some common interest

[00:08:54 - 00:08:59] in that we were both interested in the acoustic domain.

[00:08:59 - 00:09:01] So that was a rich connection.

[00:09:02 - 00:09:07] I must say I used the body of people at the AI lab

[00:09:08 - 00:09:09] to my own advantage.

[00:09:09 - 00:09:13] I was able to ask many people, many questions

[00:09:13 - 00:09:17] and get good solid answers about things

[00:09:17 - 00:09:18] that were common knowledge to those

[00:09:18 - 00:09:20] who were educated in the sciences.

[00:09:21 - 00:09:23] And so it was a very rich environment

[00:09:23 - 00:09:25] for my point of view.

[00:09:26 - 00:09:28] I think of all the people, probably David Poole,

[00:09:28 - 00:09:33] was the most important, but in my own particular work

[00:09:33 - 00:09:36] because he wrote a special compiler that was native

[00:09:36 - 00:09:40] to the PDP, six PDP 10 family of computers.

[00:09:40 - 00:09:44] And in doing that, he taught me programming

[00:09:44 - 00:09:46] and assembly language, what not.

[00:09:46 - 00:09:51] And sort of shepherded me through the life of the AI lab,

[00:09:51 - 00:09:54] protecting me from occasionally arrogant sciences

[00:09:54 - 00:09:58] who would have scientists who would have liked

[00:09:58 - 00:10:00] less competition for compute cycles.

[00:10:00 - 00:10:04] But in general, it was a pretty nice environment

[00:10:04 - 00:10:05] and supportive, I would say.
